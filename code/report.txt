Assignment 3: 3D Rendering

What the code does and doesn't do
-----------------------------------

The code reads in a txt file containing polygon and lighting information and renders the polygons
with correct colors/lighting. The user can rotate the polygons using the left/right/up/down buttons.

The user can also add a light source from the bottom left and bottom right corners, and change their
colors/intensity using the sliders (top 3 sliders are color, bottom slider is intensity).

The code does not use Gouraud shading to make smooth, curved surfaces, or use Phong shading.

Bugs
----

Occasionally whiskers and holes can be seen around some of the polygons.

One quirk which isn't necessarily a bug is that the bottom left and right light sources are fixed, whereas
the incident light source given from the txt file moves when the viewing direction is changed (as per the 
requirements).

How was this tested?
--------------------

Unit tests for calculating edge list, hiding polygons, rotating polygons, calculating shading of a polygon,
and calculating the z-buffer.

Other than that, manual testing by loading all text files from the data folder, checking rendering vs the 
example image that is given with each txt file.
